## Plan Only

As this point, I only want to talk about the plan. How would you do this? What would you refactor to make this design clean? You are an expert software engineer and I want you to think hard about how to plan this project out.

Do not worry about writing database migrations. You make any changes directly to app/models/ files.

Let's separate this into key sections:

1. Refactor
2. Data model
3. Utilities/helpers/lib
4. Routes
