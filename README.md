# Opinionated Defaults for Structlog

Logging is really important. Getting logging to work well in python feels like black magic: there's a ton of configuration
across structlog, warnings, std loggers, fastapi + celery context, JSON logging in production, etc that requires lots of
fiddling and testing to get working. I finally got this working for me in my [project template](https://github.com/iloveitaly/python-starter-template) and extracted this out into a nice package.

Here are the main goals:

* High performance JSON logging in production
* All loggers, even plugin or system loggers, should route through the same formatter
* Structured logging everywhere
* Ability to easily set thread-local log context
* Nice log formatters for stack traces, ORM ([ActiveModel/SQLModel](https://github.com/iloveitaly/activemodel)), etc
* Ability to log level and output (i.e. file path) *by logger* for easy development debugging
* If you are using fastapi, structured logging for access logs

## Usage

```python
from structlog_config import configure_logging

configure_logging()
```

## Stdib Log Management

By default, all stdlib loggers are:

1. Given the same global logging level, with some default adjustments for noisy loggers (looking at you, `httpx`)
2. Use a structlog formatter (you get structured logging, context, etc in any stdlib logger calls)
3. The root processor is overwritten so any child loggers created after initialization will use the same formatter

You can customize loggers by name (i.e. the name used in `logging.getLogger(__name__)`) using ENV variables.

For example, if you wanted to [mimic `OPENAI_LOG` functionality](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/de7c0e2d9375d042a42e3db6c17e5af9a5701a99/src/openai/_utils/_logs.py#L16):

* `LOG_LEVEL_OPENAI=DEBUG`
* `LOG_PATH_OPENAI=tmp/openai.log`
* `LOG_LEVEL_HTTPX=DEBUG`
* `LOG_PATH_HTTPX=tmp/openai.log`

## FastAPI Access Logger

Structured, simple access log with request timing to replace the default fastapi access log. Why?

1. It's less verbose
2. Uses structured logging params instead of string interpolation
3. debug level logs any static assets

Here's how to use it:

1. [Disable fastapi's default logging.](https://github.com/iloveitaly/python-starter-template/blob/f54cb47d8d104987f2e4a668f9045a62e0d6818a/main.py#L55-L56)
2. [Add the middleware to your FastAPI app.](https://github.com/iloveitaly/python-starter-template/blob/f54cb47d8d104987f2e4a668f9045a62e0d6818a/app/routes/middleware/__init__.py#L63-L65)

## iPython

Often it's helpful to update logging level within an iPython session. You can do this and make sure all loggers pick up on it.

```
%env LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
from structlog_config import configure_logger
configure_logger()
```
