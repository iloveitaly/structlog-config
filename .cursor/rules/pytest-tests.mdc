## Pytest Tests

- Look to @tests/factories.py to generate any required database state
  - For example, to create and persist a `Distribution` record `DistributionFactory.save()`
  - If a factory doesn't exist for the model you are working with, create one.
  - You can customize one or more params in a factory using `DistributionFactory.save(host="custom_host.com)`
- Use the `faker` factory to generate emails, etc.
- Do not mock or patch unless I instruct you to. Test as much of the application stack as possible in each test.
- If you get lazy attribute errors, or need a database session to share across logic, use the `db_session` fixture to fix the issue.
  - Note that when writing route tests a `db_session` is not needed for the logic inside of the route.
- When testing Stripe, use the sandbox API. Never mock out Stripe interactions unless explicitly told to.
- Omit obvious docstrings and comments.
